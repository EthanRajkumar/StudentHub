Analyze LeopardWeb and other interfaces similar to it to
Observe what components are needed to implement, configure, revise  //I think some components to list here could include potential libraries, SQL Database, and/or the IDE itself -Chris
Use components and modify them to fit user needs // What kinds of components could we adapt from other interfaces? What would we be better off constructing ourselves? -Ethan
Develop and integrate all components and configure them to fit the system
Test and validate that the system functions as intended
