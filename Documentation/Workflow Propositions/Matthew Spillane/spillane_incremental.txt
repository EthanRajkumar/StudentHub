Incremental Model

1st version:
Users should be to the most basic functions in a text-based form.
2nd version:
Users should now be able to use most 
available functions that will be added to the system
and basic user-interface will be implemented.  //I'm assuming this means a text-based menu UI inside the console? -Chris
3rd version:
Users should be able to use all promised features
and new features that were discussed later in development 
will start to implemented here.
User-interace will be more developed.  //and this is where we implement the GUI? -Chris
4th/Final Version:
All bugs will be fixed.  //I feel like we should fix bugs as they pop up via unit testing, so that development of subsequent components/increments is smoother and issues are easier to track/manage -Chris
Will implement suggestions/fixes reported by users.
All promised features will be fully implemented 
and possibly improved from user data. // At what point will we collect user data? In between veresions 3 and 4? Will we conduct more testing after all the features are fully developed? -Ethan
