First Iteration (Assignment 1)
-main method, parent class User, child classes Student, Instructor, Admin
-all User classes (including child classes) have attributes firstname, lastname, ID
-all classes can print out their attributes
-empty/print statement void methods for each class as placeholders for future methods

Second Iteration (Login integration)
-main method programmed to prompt user to log in with ID and password
-password attributes added to User class + child classes
-array of different User child objects
-each login attempt traverses array of User objects for matching ID + password
-upon successful login, repeating console UI displays menu options/methods based on user's object class

Third Iteration (Course integration)
-new class Course, attributes time/days/CRN/name/section/instructor/roster
-add (array?) attribute courselist to Student and Instructor classes
-array of universal pre-set courses in main method or separate file
-flesh out all class methods to traverse/interact with courselist attributes and array of courses
	-User method to sort courselist array into chronological order schedule 
	-Student can add/drop courses into courselist, search/print courses, print courselist/schedule
	-Instructor can print courselist/schedule, search courses
	-Admin can add/remove courses, add/remove students from courses, search/print courses/course rosters, 	 	 add/remove users

Fourth Iteration (Database integration)
-transition system courses from array in main method to a separate database
-adjust all affected methods to interface with database instead of deprecated array

Final Iteration (GUI integration)
-Create connected GUI scenes that interface with main program to carry out all functionalities with visual displays
